This simple and stupid project is just a collection of things related to Spring MVC

The idea of the projet is to showcase different features of Spring MVC in a single 
web application. The features on the radar for this showcase are the following:

- REST endpoints
- Custom output (XML, json)
- Content negociation
- Runtime deployment of HTTP endpoints with various strategies
- Views resolution
